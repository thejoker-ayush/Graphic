# ARTISTIC PROFILE

### Hi There ðŸ‘‹

Here I would like to portray some graphic work that I have had the opportunity to contribute. 
(Since I am made this repository in 2023, this contains only the past work that I could find from the past years and the work done thereafter. )

### RECOGNISED WORK

Here, I would like to display the work that was appreciated on a large scale.

1. This is the Planetary Sciences Front Cover I made for Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad that represents a pre-solar system containing a picture of CaI chrondite sample found in pre-solar grains.

This section represents the posters made for friends and family for their companies and their personal use.



For other work like video editting and photos, you can check them out at my Instagram handle or Youtube Channel.
